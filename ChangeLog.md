Release page: https://modrinth.com/mod/themakkersmod/version/2.0.0
<br/>**THE PORT IS FINALLY HERE**

This update is relatively big! We decided to move on from MCreator and develop our code in source! Not much changed in assets, textures besides a few things:
* The texture and model of the Moos Statue has changed.
* An Update Book has been added and will be given to the player when creating a world.
* The appearance of the Knakworst Store has been changed.
* The Knakworst Oven is now actually functionable!
